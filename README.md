## Installation

Get your dose of indecisiveness straight from the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Aizhe.magiceightball).

Once you've got VS Code open, navigate to the extension panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd(⌘)+Shift+X` on MacOS) and search for the "Magic 8-Ball" extension. Click install and let the uncertainty begin!


## How to Use

Once you've succumbed to the whims of randomness by installing, summon the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd(⌘)+Shift+P` on MacOS).

Execute the "Start touching 8-ball" command (`vscode-magiceightball.start`) to bring the chaos of the 8-ball into your VS Code workspace.

## Extension Settings

Want to amplify the uncertainty? You can configure whether to view the 8-ball in the explorer view or in a separate panel via `vscode-magiceightball.position`. Because who needs stability when you can have a swirling vortex of unpredictability?
